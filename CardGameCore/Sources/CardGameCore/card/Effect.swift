/// Effects have full power to update the game state
/// They can be resolved recursively to determine undetermined arguments
/// When dispatching an effect it can have 3 outcomes
/// - effect just prepared, triggering additional effects, donâ€™t remove from queue
/// - effect partially resolved, replace with child effects
/// - effect resolved, remove from queue, you could render it
